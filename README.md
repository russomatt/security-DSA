# Final Project for Communication Systems Security

This was a group project with myself, Matt Russo, with Kasturi Moore and Deep Bhatt

My contribution of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/russomatt/security-DSA/blob/master/DSA/main.c)

I wrote the KeyGen and Sign methods and the neccessary helper methods to achieve the described functionality in this [documentation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447), more specifically in section [8.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-8.1)
